Naivecoin Stake is a tutorial to build from scratch a cryptocurrency using the Proof of Stake consensus.

Most of this amazing work has been done by [Lauri Hartikka](https://lhartikk.github.io/), find the original tutorial here: [https://lhartikk.github.io](https://lhartikk.github.io) üëè

I copied his tutorial for learning purpose, and I only replaced the "Proof of Work (mining)" consensus with "Proof of Stake (minting)". The reason why is pretty simple, Proof of Work is always criticized for using a lot of energy, and Proof of Stake is always showed as an energy efficient alternative üå≥

Since I didn't find any tutorial for a Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation, I decided to investigate myself and implement it into a fork of [Naivecoin](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivecoin). 

This implementation of the Proof of Stake concensus is very simple and therefore cannot be used in production.
